# Lem-in

Algorithmic project meant to find the quickest way to get n ants üêú across the farm (from start to end-room).<br/>
Project allows to dive into graph theory,
as well as develop effective algorithm to transfer ants throughout the farm's labyrinth.<br/>
**[Click here to see the subject.](https://github.com/akorzhak/Lem-in/blob/master/lem-in.en.pdf)**

Project is written in **MVC** pattern. The ways are built using **BFS** algoritm.<br/>
Allocation of given ants between valid ways is done using self-developed algorithm.

### To run the project:
1. make<br/>
2. ./lem-in [-a] [-e] < maps/[some_map.txt]<br/>
3. make fclean<br/>
